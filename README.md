Greetings,

With a foundational training in physics, I have cultivated an insatiable curiosity that propels me into the realms of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Optimization. This journey has instilled in me a distinctive analytical mindset, enabling me to approach intricate problems, especially within computer sciences and mathematics, with a fresh perspective and strategic approximations.

Outside the professional sphere, my passions extend to board games, Capture The Flag competitions, martial arts, and an ever-expanding reading list. Leaderboards ignite my competitive drive, constantly urging me to raise the bar and surpass my own benchmarks.

While I thrive in individual endeavors, I am a firm advocate for the power of collaboration. I believe that while individuality might bring swift achievements, it is the collective spirit that charts the path to lasting success. My mission to broaden horizons resonates in my continuous self-improvement initiatives, as evidenced by my proactive use of tools like "Obsidian" to amplify both my personal and professional knowledge reservoirs.
